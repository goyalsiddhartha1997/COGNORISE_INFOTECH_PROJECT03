🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Project 🚢

Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project! This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster or not. It is a classic machine learning problem that is perfect for beginners looking to explore data science concepts. Let us dive in! 🌊

 🎯 Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine if a passenger on the Titanic would have survived based on their characteristics, like age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more.

 ✨ Key Steps in the Project

1. Load Data 📂
   - Load the dataset and perform initial inspections to understand the structure and content.
  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
   - Analyse distributions, look for patterns, and explore survival rates based on various features like gender, age, class, and more.

3. Data Preprocessing 🧹
   - Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features to prepare the data for model training.

4. Feature Selection 🧩
   - Select important features for better model performance.

5. Model Training 🤖
   - Train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict survival.

6. Model Evaluation 📊
   - Evaluate models based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.


 💡 Project Highlights

- Easy-to-follow steps: Great for beginners learning data science concepts.
- Detailed EDA: Explore survival patterns among different passenger groups.
- Multiple Models: Try out Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest for comparison.
- Feature Importance: Understand which features impact survival the most.

 🧪 Model Performance

Each model is evaluated based on accuracy and classification metrics. Here’s an example of how results are presented in the notebook:

- Logistic Regression: Accuracy ~ 80%
- Decision Tree: Accuracy ~ 78%
- Random Forest: Accuracy ~ 82%

Note: Results may vary slightly depending on random seed and parameter settings.

 📊 Visualizations

Throughout the notebook, you'll find various plots that help visualize:

- Survival distribution 📈
- Gender and class-wise survival 📊
- Age distribution among passengers 📉

 📚 Dataset Information

The Titanic dataset is publicly available and contains the following columns:

- Survived: 0 = No, 1 = Yes
- Pclass: Passenger Class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- Sex: Gender of the passenger
- Age: Age in years
- SibSp:  of siblings/spouses aboard
- Parch:  of parents/children aboard
- Fare: Ticket fare
- Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

 🚀 Future Improvements

- Implement other machine learning models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting).
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
